# TDZ Games

Enjoy the little game and join us on our YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/@tabledropzone, where we discuss this game and so much more!

To us games are another way to tell a story, very much on par with books, movies, painting/image creation, theatre, audioplays, music and other forms of story telling. Stroies are important as they build one of the most important foundations of any form of art, culture and society. However, stories can also just be fun and entertaining and still carry importance. 
We want to add a small disclaimer here. While we strongly believe that ass stories are important and should be conserved, not all stories are to be seen as having a positive impact. Conserving them is nontheless important for educational reasons. We can only improve our future if we don't forget or change the memory of our past.

In an effort to create and tell our stories, we are tapping into many different types of media and experiemnt with many different concepts and ideas. This page is to be seen in conjunktion with our youtube channel, where we discuss whatever we publish here on these pages. Our github will be dedcated to ideas and experiments on different programmable aspects of storty telling. In better words, on this page we will present a collection of smaller games and other interactive media that we have created for you to enjoy. 
Jump in and enjoy our stories :)

Game 1: Welcome to Lungeon
==========================

The tiny dungeon crawler for the small appetite

This little game was design to be a virtual version of our tabletop pocket RPG of the same name. Feel free to download the free rulebook here: [https://www.tabledropzone.com/downloads/tdz-house-rules](https://www.tabledropzone.com/downloads/tdz-house-rules)  
In this guide we will show you the very basics of how the game is played. everthing else, you need to figure out by yourself. watch the log window for hints and easter eggs. there is a lot to discover in the tiny world of these tiny dungeons.  

Gettig started
--------------

To enter a dungeon click start and then choose a class. each class has different attributes:  
  

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![](images/Paladinbig.png)  <br>**Sir Diamondheart** | ![](images/Barbarianbig.png)  <br>**Gronk** | ![](images/Thiefbig.png)  <br>**Silk** | ![](images/Wizardbig.png)  <br>**Magus the Grandwizard of Overhelm Son of the grand mage of Undertuxton bearer of the veil, watcher of the void** |
| Paladin | Barbarian | Thief | Wizard |
| This is the default class. | Gronk has axe Uahahaha. | She finds treasure where nobody else would look. | He can do magic better. |
| Life: 3  <br>Mana: 1 | Life: 4  <br>Mana: 0 | Life: 2  <br>Mana: 1 | Life: 2  <br>Mana: 2 |

  

Controls
--------

Once you have chosen your class, it is off to the adventure.  
Move around using the red arrow buttons (e.g. ![](images/NW2.png)) and click ![](images/btn-ATK.png) for attacking, ![](images/btn-magic.png) for casting a spell (instant kill - if you have the spell and mana) and ![](images/btn-open.png) to open treasure chests.

Battle
------

You will battle monsters in 3 categories:  

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![](images/Skull130.png) | Slime: wipe it away with a tissue |
| ![](images/Skull230.png) | Hulk: They only want to cuddle... I'm fairly certain |
| ![](images/Skull330.png) | Dragon: This will leave a mark |

  
Every encounter locks the player into battle until it is initially resolved. If the player gets hurt, he can chose to avoid the monster for now and chose a different path. However, for leveling up the player will need to slay monsters.

Levelup
-------

Prog stand for progress and gets a bar every time a monster is slain. Once 3 monsters are slayn the plaer gains one level. This makes fights easier

Treasure
--------

You will com across tresure chests. here and there and everywhere. Open them using "OPN" and be surprised what you can find.  
... and no Gronk, you cannot eat them!  
(the exact information is in the rulebook).


Game 2: Deception Systems
=========================

You are a gumshoe detective in this old school point-and-click closed room murder mystery.
